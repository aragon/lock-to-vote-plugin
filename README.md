# Lock to Vote Plugin

NOTE: This is a work in progress plugin, early alpha stage. The contracts haven't been reviewed, tested or audited yet. DO NOT USE on any serious deployment.

This reposity contains the codebase of the Lock to Vote plugin for OSx, along with its helper contract.

## Overview

## Get Started

To get started, ensure that [Foundry](https://getfoundry.sh/) and [Make](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/) are installed on your computer.

### Using the Makefile

The `Makefile` is the target launcher of the project. It's the recommended way to work with it. It manages the env variables of common tasks and executes only the steps that need to be run.

```
$ make
Available targets:

- make init       Check the dependencies and prompt to install if needed
- make clean      Clean the build artifacts

- make test            Run unit tests, locally
- make test-coverage   Generate an HTML coverage report under ./report

- make sync-tests       Scaffold or sync tree files into solidity tests
- make check-tests      Checks if solidity files are out of sync
- make markdown-tests   Generates a markdown file with the test definitions rendered as a tree

- make pre-deploy-testnet        Simulate a deployment to the testnet
- make pre-deploy-prodnet        Simulate a deployment to the production network

- make deploy-testnet        Deploy to the testnet and verify
- make deploy-prodnet        Deploy to the production network and verify

- make refund   Refund the remaining balance left on the deployment account
```

Run `make init`:
- It ensures that Foundry is installed
- It runs a first compilation of the project
- It copies `.env.example` into `.env`

Next, customize the values of `.env`.

### Understanding `.env.example`

The env.example file contains descriptions for all the initial settings. You don't need all of these right away but should review prior to fork tests and deployments

### Deployment Checklist

  - At least, 15% more than the estimated simulation
- [ ] Unit tests still run clean
- [ ] I have run `git status` and it reports no local changes
- [ ] The current local git branch (`main`) corresponds to its counterpart on `origin`
  - [ ] I confirm that the rest of members of the ceremony pulled the last commit of my branch and reported the same commit hash as my output for `git log -n 1`
- [ ] I have initiated the production deployment with `make deploy-prodnet`

### Post deployment checklist

- [ ] The deployment process completed with no errors
- [ ] The deployed factory was deployed by the deployment address
- [ ] The reported contracts have been created created by the newly deployed factory
- [ ] The smart contracts are correctly verified on Etherscan or the corresponding block explorer
- [ ] The output of the latest `deployment-*.log` file corresponds to the console output
- [ ] I have transferred the remaining funds of the deployment wallet to the address that originally funded it
  - `make refund`

## Manual deployment (CLI)

You can of course run all commands from the command line:

```sh
# Load the env vars
source .env
```

```sh
# run unit tests
forge test --no-match-path "test/fork/**/*.sol"
```

```sh
# Set the right RPC URL
RPC_URL="https://eth-sepolia.g.alchemy.com/v2/${ALCHEMY_API_KEY}"
```

```sh
# Run the deployment script

# If using Etherscan
forge script --chain "$NETWORK" script/Deploy.s.sol:Deploy --rpc-url "$RPC_URL" --broadcast --verify

# If using BlockScout
forge script --chain "$NETWORK" script/Deploy.s.sol:Deploy --rpc-url "$RPC_URL" --broadcast --verify --verifier blockscout --verifier-url "https://sepolia.explorer.mode.network/api\?"
```

If you get the error Failed to get EIP-1559 fees, add `--legacy` to the command:

```sh
forge script --chain "$NETWORK" script/Deploy.s.sol:Deploy --rpc-url "$RPC_URL" --broadcast --verify --legacy
```

If some contracts fail to verify on Etherscan, retry with this command:

```sh
forge script --chain "$NETWORK" script/Deploy.s.sol:Deploy --rpc-url "$RPC_URL" --verify --legacy --private-key "$DEPLOYMENT_PRIVATE_KEY" --resume
```

## Testing

See the [test tree](./TEST_TREE.md) file for a visual representation of the implemented tests.

Tests can be described using yaml files. They will be automatically transformed into solidity test files with [bulloak](https://github.com/alexfertel/bulloak).

Create a file with `.t.yaml` extension within the `test` folder and describe a hierarchy of test cases:

```yaml
# MyPluginTest.t.yaml

MyPluginTest:
- given: proposal exists
  comment: Comment here
  and:
  - given: proposal is in the last stage
    and:

    - when: proposal can advance
      then:
      - it: Should return true

    - when: proposal cannot advance
      then:
      - it: Should return false

  - when: proposal is not in the last stage
    then:
    - it: should do A
      comment: This is an important remark
    - it: should do B
    - it: should do C

- when: proposal doesn't exist
  comment: Testing edge cases here
  then:
  - it: should revert
```

Then use `make` to automatically sync the described branches into solidity test files.

```sh
$ make
Available targets:
# ...
- make sync-tests       Scaffold or sync tree files into solidity tests
- make check-tests      Checks if solidity files are out of sync
- make markdown-tests   Generates a markdown file with the test definitions rendered as a tree

$ make sync-tests
```

The final output will look like a human readable tree:

```
# MyPluginTest.tree

MyPluginTest
├── Given proposal exists // Comment here
│   ├── Given proposal is in the last stage
│   │   ├── When proposal can advance
│   │   │   └── It Should return true
│   │   └── When proposal cannot advance
│   │       └── It Should return false
│   └── When proposal is not in the last stage
│       ├── It should do A // Careful here
│       ├── It should do B
│       └── It should do C
└── When proposal doesn't exist // Testing edge cases here
    └── It should revert
```

And the given tree file will be used by bulloak to produce test file templates where tests can be addeed to.
